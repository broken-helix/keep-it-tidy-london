# **GT Modellista Blog - Introduction**
GT Modellista is blog site for car enthusiasts to share their passions with other like-minded individuals from around the world. This project is a Full-Stack development website built using the Django framework. GT Modellista allows registered users to post articles in the Build Threads section of the page and view, edit or delete their posts in the My Threads section. Registered users are also able to like and comment on posts made by other members of the community.

### **Agile Methodology**

For planning the developement and implementation of GT Modellista, a project kanban board was used as an Agile Tool through Github. This project board utilised issues as 'User Stories', a link can be found [here](https://github.com/AndyL86/gt-modellista/issues).

To help define the functionalities and prioritise key features, these 'User Stories' were broken down into 3 categories of importance; 'Must Have', 'Should Have' and 'Could Have'.

'Must Have' represents a feature or functionality that is essential to the site, 'Should Have' is a defined requirement needed for the site and 'Could Have' is determined to be optional.

### **The Scope**

#### **The Site's Main Goals:**
- To provide users with a user-friendly and positive experience when using GT Modellista.
- To provide users with a clear understanding of the site's purpose.
- To provide controlled functionality based on a user's permissions.
- To provide user's with a profile that allows them to manage their own content.

## **DESIGN**

### **Colours**
- For the colour schema of the site I opted for a dark theme for the header and footer, using #24272C with a contrasting lighter neutral page background colour of #C0C4CA. This is so user's can easily differentiate between the different sections of the page. I used [ColourSpace](https://mycolor.space/) to generate the colour pallette I wanted.
- The button styling was inspired by the retro PlayStation 1 game 'Gran Turismo 2'. For the background colour I used #f7b91e.
- The Navigation menu and Header font colour chosen is rgb(201, 203, 204).

### **Typography**
- I chose 'Roboto Slab' for my Navigation menu and Header Title fonts, with a supporting font of 'serif' incase of loading failure. This font ide was inspired by a VW Golf GTI badge.
- The Header text and Build Thread title text use 'Noto Sans JP' and 'sans serif' as a backup. This was chosen for its clean presentation and easy readability.
- All fonts were sourced through [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### **Media**
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used for the design of my wireframes and database schema.
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) were used for the header and Partners images.
- The GTM logo is my own design and post list images are my own images.

## **FEATURES**

### **Navigation**

#### **Desktop Navigation**
- The navigation bar is located at the top of each page on the site and has a sticky functionality to pin the nav bar at the top of the page when scrolled. This is to allow the user ease of navigation when browsing the site.
- The menu contains links for the 'Home Page', 'About Page', 'GT Modellista Page' and a dropdown link containing the 'Featured Threads Page', 'Register Account Page' and a 'Login Page' link. 
- Once the user is logged in the dropdown menu includes a link to the user's 'My Threads Page' and the login link is replaced with the 'Logout Page' link.
- The navbar is fully responsive and collapses into a burger menu for mobile devices.
![Desktop Nav](docs/read-me/desktop-nav.png)

#### **Mobile Navigation**
- Presented as a burger menu for design responsiveness.
- Once clicked a dropdown menu appears including all the page links as above, including the dropdown menu.
![Mobile Nav](docs/read-me/mobile-nav.png)


### **Footer**
- Located at the bottom of the page the footer contains links to social media platforms. I wanted to keep the footer as simple as possible to allow users easier navigation of the site by keeping any page links in one menu.
![Footer](docs/read-me/footer.png)

### **Home Page**
- Upon landing on the homepage the user is presented with a header banner which details the sites purpose and contains a click button which directs the user to the account registration page.
- Underneath the header is the carousel image real of 3 default images. Navigation icons are displayed on each side of the image and a counter tab is displayed at the bottom of the image to display which image is being displayed.
- At the bottom of the page is a 'Partners' section displaying news articles created by Admin.

### **About Page**
- The About page contains a header with styled image and the page title.
- Underneath the header is a brief description of the GT Modellista site.

### **Build Threads Blog Page**
- The Build Threads page contains all posts created by authenticated users. 
- Upon landing on the Build Threads page the user is presented with a header containing a styled image, page title and subtext. 
- Contained within the header is a click button which redirects the user to the Create Thread page.
- The page will paginate the Build Thread cards to display 6 per page.
- Each Build Thread card will display the thread title, image, author's username and the date and time the post was published.
- Each card contains a like icon and like counter to display how many likes the post has.
- Build Threads can be opened to view by clicking the thread's image.

#### **Desktop**
![Blog List](docs/read-me/blog-list.png)


### **Featured Threads Page**
- The Featured threads page displays posts selected specifically by admin.
- The header displays an image with the page title and subtext.
- Blog posts are presented in 2 columns with larger blog post cards to give a bold impression to the user.
- No users are authenticated to post build threads directly into featured.

### **My Threads Page**
- Authenticated users can view a list of their posted build threads.
- At the bottom of each blog post card displays the edit and delete buttons
![My Threads](docs/read-me/my-threads.png)

### **Create Build Thread Page**
- The Create Thread page allows authenticated users to post their own Build Thread blog post.
- The create thread form contains mandatory fields for: Vehicle Year, Vehicle Model, Vehicle Make, a link to upload an image, a text box for the user's story and a text box for the vehicle's modifications.
- Each text box uses Summernote to allow text styling to be applied.
- The create thread confirm button is located at the bottom of the page.
- If an unauthenticated user tries to access the Create Thread page they are presented with an access denied error.
![Create Thread](docs/read-me/create-post.png)

### **Thread Details Page**
- When a Build Thread is selected the user is brought to the Thread Details page detailing all the information the author has provided.
- The main body of the page displays the vehicle year, make and model as the page title, below this are 2 text box areas containing the 'Story' and 'Modifications' sections and the thread image.
- Below the image is a 'heart' icon with a number counter, this allows authenticated users to like the thread and provides a total number of likes to all users.
- Alternatively, if the heart icon has already been selected showing a like, the heart can be unselected to remove the like.
![Thread Details](docs/read-me/thread-details.png)

### **Comments Section**
- At the bottom of the page all users are able to view the comments section.
- Authenticated users are able to leave comments.
![Comments Section](docs/read-me/comments.png)

#### **Edit/Delete Comments**
- For authenticated users the Edit and Delete comments buttons are visible underneath the relevant comment posted by the user. 
- I would have liked to spend more time styling these buttons but due to time contraints I was unable to carry out any further styling.
![Edit/Delete Comments](docs/read-me/edit-comments.png)

### **Future Features**
- Implementation of user profiles to allow registered users to personalise their account.
- Events page with a calender and notifications functionality.
